### Data Construction for AgentTTS
+ KGQA (CWQ, WebQSP)
We gratefully acknowledge the open-source code from the paper
**"Generate-on-Graph: Treat LLM as both Agent and KG in Incomplete Knowledge Graph Question Answering"**,
which significantly facilitated the construction of datasets for knowledge graph question answering (KGQA) tasks.

+ Retrieval-based QA (2WikiMultiHopQA, HotpotQA)
`retrieval_QA_data_generator.py` This script is used to craft data for retrieval-based QA tasks.
